Only 2015.csv and 2016.csv because there are no data in the next years about suicide rates.

My research question: 
- How does population effects the suicide rate of a country?
- Do suicide rates depend on the gender, how?
- What generation are committing suicides the most?
- Do gross domestic product for a year effects the suicide rate of a country?
- Do gross domestic product for capita effect the suicide rate of a country?
- What makes people in a country happy?
- How does happiness rate of a country effect the suicide rates of the same country?
- How will the suicide rates behave in the next years to come?


My hypothesis: 
- Does males are more suicidal than the females?
- Does more population mean more suicide rate?


Experiments I expect to do: 
- Describing the data and analyzing the mean, standard deviation and such.
- Analyzing the correlations of the data.
- Plotting histograms, scatter diagrams, bar plots for some countries.
- Using machine learning tools to predict next yearâ€™s rates.
